## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npx expo start` to launch the Expo development server
4. Follow the Expo prompts to launch the app on a device or simulator

## Color Scheme

This template organizes colors intuitively to streamline styling your app. It includes 11 pre-configured gradients that can easily be used on any component. See the `Colors.ts` file for the full list of available colors and gradients.

## Custom Components

I've built a library of reusable custom components to accelerate app development. Browse the `/app/custom-components` directory to see the available components. Import them into your screens and use them just like any other component.

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Main source code
  - `/assets` - Images, fonts and other static assets
  - `/custom-components` - Reusable custom components
  - `/constants` - Constants and configuration
  - `/screens` - App screen components
- `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/ios` - iOS native code
- `/android` - Android native code

## Expo Commands

This template uses the latest version of Expo. Instead of `expo start`, use:

- `npx expo start` - Launch the Expo development server
- `npx expo <command>` - Run any other Expo command
